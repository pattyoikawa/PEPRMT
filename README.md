A biogeochemical model for simulating CO2 and CH4 exchange in restored wetlands
in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta
All models are parameterized for the Delta and should be re-evaluated before applying to wetland sites outside the Delta.
Models were uploaded in October 2016 pending publication:
